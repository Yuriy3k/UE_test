I've imported Lin2 with fbx import so it could be normaly positioned and it was. Instead if Daz3D import plugin that imports turned 90 degrees, I had issues with it and they were resolved, but next issues appeared)
So my logic was like this:
1. Import Lin2 figure
2. Make an IK Rig for her (Lin2rig)
3. Make an IK retargeter (UEtoGen9New)
4. Import standard animations (do not include, but retargeter and animations were Manny)
5. After retargeting everything looks fine, but now I have problems with control rig. It works with walking and running, but does not work with adapting legs to different levels of the ground, also when I jump figure rotates forward in X axis
6. So I totally need to understand how it all works and I'm planning doing my own animations and movement scripts, so I want to know how to put all this together)
